# Custom Hooks Implementation

## Scenario

In modern React development, abstracting reusable logic into custom Hooks is a fundamental practice for building maintainable and scalable applications. You’ve been tasked with developing two common custom Hooks: usePagination for managing client-side pagination logic, and useDebounce for debouncing rapidly changing values, often used with search inputs.<br>

This lab will challenge you to think about hook design, state management within hooks, handling dependencies, and ensuring your hooks are generic enough for reuse.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this lab, you will be able to:<br>

- Design and implement reusable custom React Hooks from scratch.
- Encapsulate complex logic and state management within a custom Hook.
- Effectively manage dependencies and side effects within custom Hooks.
- Understand how to return values and functions from custom Hooks for use in components.
- Apply custom Hooks to solve common problems like pagination and debouncing input.
- Consider basic performance aspects (e.g., memoization) where applicable within custom Hooks.
